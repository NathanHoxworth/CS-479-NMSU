NjRAT is a malware that has keylogging capabilities, webcam access, can upload and download files, steal any saved browser credentials, execute shell commands, modify regstries, take screen captures, and view the desktop of the computer, as well as open a backdoor for any attackers to use to gain access to the machine. 
It was first found in 2012 and is still used today by many attackers to gain access to systems across the world. Most recently, it has been used against organizations in the Middle East and North Africa. 
It is mostly spread through removable drives, phishing attacks, and interacting with other malicious software. 
It is also coommonly used for botnet C&C and was responsible for many of the attacks against Ukraine using its botnet capabilities. 
NjRAT also uses fileless storage by storing all of its keylogged data within a registry named '[kl]' and avoids saving any .dll plugins as files, but rather as registries, so as to be harder for any antivirus to remove them.
