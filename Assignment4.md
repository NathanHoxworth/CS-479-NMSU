# Controlflow1
Solution: 
* 16+ characters
* 1st character is an 'A'
* 2nd character is '6'
* 4th character is '2'
* 8th character is '%'
* 16th character is '*'

Keygen code:

	import random

	import string

	output = ''

	var = random.randint(16,20)

	i = 0

	while (i < var):

		if (i == 0):
			output += 'A'
		
		elif (i == 1):
			output += '6'
			
		elif (i == 3):
			output += '2'
		
		elif (i == 7):
			output += '%'
		
		elif (i == 15):
			output += '*'
		
		else:
			output += str(random.randint(0,9))
		
		i += 1
	print(output)
