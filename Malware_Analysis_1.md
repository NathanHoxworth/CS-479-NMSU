# Indicators of Compromise

This malware is very easy to detect as it seems to place a file anywhere and everywhere that they can to make sure you see it and know that the ransomware is there

# Clues about Origin

The malware wants you to send money to an email ending in .ch which is the domain for Switzerland so it is possible that the malware is originating from Switzerland, however, due to Switzerland's lax laws on banking and money, it is almost a guarantee that the Switzerland address is just somewhere to collect the money to then be transferred into other accounts. In VirusTotal, there were 16 contained instances of this malware, 13 of which were in Russian and then 3 in United States English since 2018. Almost all of the Russian ones are type RT_ICON and a few are other types, while the US ones are all different types. This makes it seem likely that this is a Russian originating virus designed for attacks on the US and possibly domestically as well. The simplicity of it also means that is most likely nothing done by the government, but just a small group of Russian hackers trying to get some money.

Once the virus is in your system, it begins to move through all your files, deleting everything it can and placing a ton of text files that all tell you to pay money to get your files back, if it doesn't get access to certain locations, it just keeps moving laterally until it finds the next location that it can access instead of attempting to break into those locations that it cannot access.
